Reverb Plugin for Digital Audio Effects module at Birmingham City University

Part of three audio effect plugins created in JUCE for my Digital Audio Effects module at Birmingham City University

This assessment emulates a real-world project in which you are expected to prototype, build, test, and document a number of audio processing modules that would be deployed in a commercial system.

Description: You are required to implement three digital audio effects using Matlab and apply them to an audio file, which will be hosted on the main page of the DAFx UG3 Moodle site.

You should choose one effect from each of the following groups:

Group 1: -----------------------------------------------------------

Amplitude, frequency or channel modulation
Digital Filter or Equaliser
Delay effect including feedback, ping-pong, vibrato, phasor, tremolo Group 2: -----------------------------------------------------------
Distortion effect including soft clipping and non-linear modelling
Dynamics processor (compressor, expander, ducker, limiter, etc)
Pitch shifter or time stretcher Group 3: -----------------------------------------------------------
Algorithmic reverb
Spectral processor (frequency shifter, phase manipulation, frequency analyser)
Machine learning algorithm (humanisation, timbre classifier, source separator, etc)
Your real-time implementation should take the audio effects that you have prototyped in Matlab, and upscale them to work with frames of input audio in real-time. You should submit all real-time code in a zip format. Depending on the framework you choose, the source code format will vary.

Workload: You are required to produce a code during and outside of timetabled sessions. It is expected that you will need to spend a similar time outside of these sessions to complete your work. In addition you will need to attend a viva to demonstrate your knowledge of the system you have developed. The assessment is equivalent to a word count of 4000 words. Note that this is not the required word count for your slides!! Notional hours to complete this assignment is 40 hours.
